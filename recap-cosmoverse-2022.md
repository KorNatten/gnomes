Gno.land will be the hub of Gnolang chains with the intention of providing libraries for building other chainsâ€™ contracts as well
as a way to reward people for developing good contracts or libraries.

Gnolang language is inspired by Golang, and it aims to be a good entry point for web3 developers as it is structured the same as
developing an app in Golang but for building smart contracts.

Instead of app chains, Gnolang is envisioning IBC as an internet of smart contracts.

The strength of the framework includes a few key traits:
- Automatic documentation
- Same API for the Web, TXs and cross-contract calls
- Built-in gas-less rendering with support of parameters

Proof of Contribution is how Gnoland secures the chain, you can only earn $Gnosh tokens by making contributions, both technical and non-technical,
all chain fees will be placed into a bucket and distributed amongst $Gnosh holders, validators, and developers of the smart contracts and libraries.

A gnode is an approach to manage a network of DAOs and will be used to manage the Gno ecosystem using a bottom-up approach.
Gnodes are completely linked to proof of contribution, and their structure is how the growing Gnolang ecosystem will be managed.

<p/>

Gnodes are flexible implementations of a Gnolang smart-contract interface enforcing strict cooperation, and we hope that in the future this
will be applicable for many functions.
