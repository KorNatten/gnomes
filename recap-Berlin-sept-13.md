### YES, we are hiring!
We are hiring core contributors to build the best smart-contracting platform in the world.
Alums or experienced contributors to golang or anyone with the kink of creating languages that power their friends’ work. Join us!

In addition to core contributions, we will reward contract developers based on their usage (including imported libs).

Let’s reward good open-source code automatically. And let’s make a world that works like that by default.

We will organize an event in the spirit of the successful GameOfStake competition, but for contract developers and other core needs.
More details to come. **And it's not only for developers, non-tech people can join in and be rewarded for their owm contributions.**

### Our first initiative for interconnected DAOs and liquid democracy.

Imagine a smart-contract interface where communities define their own rules.
Now, make it easy to interconnect those independent communities.
The IBC spirit, at the contract level.
Imagine an ecosystem or a big group managing a global budget, vision, missions and people.
Their GNODE delegates parts of those global assets to sub-companies, which they do for teams and internal projects.
Independence meets global alignment.
Some DAO'ss will be governed by users, validators, contributors, other DAO's or a mix.
Some will be linked to bots watching external events, i.e., GitHub contributions.

*(Looking forward to discovering original/unusual governance implementations and models!)*

We’ll start using it on our main chain to manage Gnolan{d,g}, Tendermint2, IBC2, and many other packages.
We design it so it can be the engine powering liquid democracy at the scale of a planet.

### vault.gno is a way for developers to use gnolang composability to extend a GRC20 token with new features.
This will make GnoLand the best place to build DeFi dApps.

### FooToken is a new example of a GRC20 instance in a gnolang smart contract, known as realms.
