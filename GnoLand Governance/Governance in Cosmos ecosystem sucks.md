#Governance in Cosmos ecosystem sucks
Gnomes can do it better, we Gno it.

I don't want to talk about the different governance systems that could be implied (yet). I want to start with the fundamentals of governance and that should start with the proposals and discussions about a proposal. I've seen many chains/projects trying to fix things but they're just putting bandages on wounds instead of fixing the issues at the core.

### Proposal discussions

Far to many times the discussions start once the proposal is already in voting period, people flock to twitter or discord to have their say in a very anarchistic way, where one says something and someone else says something different. The main trigger is always that a proposal is not clear, open for different interpretations, .... If it's about money, most of the time it's not detailed and explained enough who gets what or when for doing what. Basically people have to vote on unclear proposals, just like the promises that politicians make before an election.

 *We'll do this and you'll see what happens, it will cost so much and you'll never know  where your money goes.*

This can be fixed in a few ways.

 - Having our own discussion forum/platform before a proposal goes online.
 - Pro

     - We don’t depend on third party software or scripts.
 - Con

     - More dev work
 - Using a third party forum, like commonwealth

     - Can we have the green, orange, red light system that either stops or allows a proposal to come on chain for voting?
