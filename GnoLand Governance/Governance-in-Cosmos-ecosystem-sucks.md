## Governance in Cosmos ecosystem sucks
### Gnomes can do it better, we Gno it.
I don't want to talk about the different governance systems that could be implied (yet). I want to start with the fundamentals of governance and that should start with the proposals and discussions about a proposal. I've seen many chains/projects trying to fix things but they're just putting bandages on wounds instead of fixing the issues at the core.

### Proposal discussions
Far to many times the discussions start once the proposal is already in voting period, people flock to twitter or discord to have their say in a very anarchistic way, where one says something and someone else says something different. The main trigger is always that a proposal is not clear, open for different interpretations, .... If it's about money, most of the time it's not detailed and explained enough who gets what or when for doing what. Basically people have to vote on unclear proposals, just like the promises that politicians make before an election.

> _We'll do this and you'll see what happens, it will cost so much and you'll never know_ _where your money goes._

## **This can be fixed in a few ways.**

 - [ ] Writing a clear code of conduct on how proposals should be written and what should be included in the text.
 
**Important points to be included in this code of conduct.**

 - No shortened URL's, this makes it dangerous for phishing attacks. We've seen it before and some chains don't even warn the people.
 - Possible different ways to propose something depending on what it is (community spend, code change, text proposal,...)
 - Possible exceptions on very urgent matters (attack, problem with chain, ...)
 - A proposal should be posted in a forum at least x amount of days before it can be submitted on chain. This prevents spam and other malicious factors. Other chains tried to fix that with making governance proposals very expensive but that didn't stop the spam at all, it just kept the props in deposit state but they were on chain, visible, including clickable malicious links. It only made it nearly impossible for someone without a large following and a lot of money, to make a proposal. 
 - The proposer should contact someone from the crew that there's a new proposal, so Gnomes can be contacted.




 #### - Having our own discussion forum/platform before a proposal goes online.
 
| PRO | CON |
|--|--|
| <ul><li>We don’t depend on third party software or scripts.</li><li>We bring people to the website where there’s more info and/or discussions</li><li>We can make it mandatory for x amount of days, before it goes on chain, that already solves the problem of spam proposals. The proposer(s) can adjust the proposal in the forum, according to the discussion. We could bring in some green/orange/red light system with x percentage, if people agree to have it on chain. This does not mean they have to agree with the proposal but that they agree that the proposal is well explained.</li><li>It’s easy to contact Gnomes that there’s a new proposal to discuss, either by email, twitter, discord, ….</li></ul> | <ul><li>More dev work</li><li>There will be a need for moderators/people sending the message out</li><li>If we use the “boards”, do we want people to pay for a transaction to discuss a proposal?</li><li>How can we have other platforms or wallets warn the users, there’s a new proposal discussion?</li></ul> |

 #### - Using a third party forum, like commonwealth.
 
| PRO | CON |
|--|--|
| <ul><li>Less dev work</li><li>We can have it under our own sub domain and people from other chains on commonwealth will still be able to see it and potentially get interested</li><li>Open source and free. The people behind commonwealth seems to be helpful too</li></ul> | <ul><li>Can we have the green, orange, red light system that either stops or allows a proposal to come on chain for voting?</li><li>Depending on third party</li><li>We still need moderators and have to use the “contact” details that people use to sign in on commonwealth. Some only use a wallet.</li></ul> |
