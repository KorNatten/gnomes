## WIP

We've all seen props with sometimes ridiculous amounts of money requested from the community, we would like to make everything as clear as possible BEFORE
those props become voteable so people can vote with a clear view on what the proposers request and what we can expect.

What should be included in a proposal to request spending money from the community pool

## What should be included
- Known name or usernames from twitter, discord, ....
- Some info about yourself
- What is the issue?
- What are you trying to resolve?
- How will you resolve the issue?
- How will the community benefit from your work?
- What justifies the request of spending money from the community pool (upfront)?
- When/how would you like the money? Is there a timeline, are you asking for a percentage of the money depending on milestones, .... 
- Do you request stablecoins or $GNOT/$GNOSH no matter what the marketconditions are?
- How many people and who's involved?
- How will you distribute the money if you're a team?
- How will you report the progress to the community?
- Do you have a detailed expenditure paper on the requested budget?
- What are the pro's and possible con's of your work?
- Who will be responsible if you don't deliver on time or what you promise? Can the community expect a reinbursement if this happens?
