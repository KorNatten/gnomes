# GnoLand Marketing for Community Members

### Some tips on marketing GnoLand on Twitter so the algorithm takes notice.

1.  Tag the official GnoLand twitter account in your tweet @\_gnoland

2.   Use some hashtags related to GnoLand

     - #GnoLand  
     - #Gnomes  
     - #GnoLang  
     - #GnoYourWorth  
     - #GnoWorldOrder  
     - #Gnot  
     - #Gnosh  
     - $GNOT  
     - $GNOSH

3.   You can also use some hastags to attract developers

     - #golang -> Twitter has a bot that RT's all tweets with #golang automatically and many devs follow it  
     - #godev  
     - #godeveloper  
     - #godevs  
     - #godevelopers  
     - #go  
     - #goland -> Online courses for Go devs

4.   Good marketing practice to attract other communities, is putting 1 hashtag in your tweet related to blockchain/crypto

     - #crypto  
     - #blockchain  
     - #blockchaintechnology  
     - #cryptoproject  
     - #cryptonews  
     - #IBCgang  
     - ... another chain, another project, use your imagination

5.   Follow the hashtags from point 2 so you can interact with them
6.   Interactions are very important

     * If you follow the hashtags, you will get to see each tweet that contains those hashtags
       - Make a comment on them, like and RT them so Twitter algorithm reads them as valuable tweets
       - You can just RT them or quote them with some catchy phrase. Don't use more then 2-3 hashtags with that phrase or it might be seen as spam.
       - They don't always have to be as a hashtag, just the words in a sentence can also be valuable for the algoritm.

7.   Never copy a tweet from someone else to tweet it yourself, you could both be shadowbanned or seen as bots.
8.   Images attract people, make a positive meme or graphic. Don't use the same graphic over and over, use some words from the hashtags when you save your images so searchengines also recognise them. (Example: gnoland-blockchain-gnomes-crypto1.png)
9.   Never write something bad about another project in the same tweet as you write about GnoLand, it's bad practice. Use your opinions about other projects in a seperate        tweet, if you wish to do so.
10.   Be carefull with combining unofficial projects on GnoLand while tweeting about GnoLand. If they are not officially endorsed by the GnoLand team, it means they are seperate projects and devs.
11.   Be very careful with rumours, always check official announcements first if they're true.
12.   (personal opinion) Don't tag influencers, they're only there to make money and INFLUENCE your mind.
